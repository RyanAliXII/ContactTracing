# Contact Tracing Web Application for School Campus

Created using **MongoDB, Express, React and Node JS**

## Description

This is my self-project made using MERN Stack. Originally, The scope of this project was national level but, I turned down the scope into school campus use. That is why there is some inconsistencies on the code, but I gave all my best to make it clean as much as possible. The reason for turning down the scope is because i am solo developer and i did not much have time because of school works. 

## How to Run

1. Run the following `git clone https://github.com/PusangMaySaging/ContactTracing.git` or download as ZIP.
2. Run `npm run serve` on parent folder and `npm run start` in client folder.
3. Enjoy 	❤️ :heart:
